// Types of observable behavior of every C++ program:

// - Ill-formed - The program has syntax errors or diagnosable semantic errors
// - Ill-formed, no diagnostic required (IFNDR) - The program has semantic errors,
//   but compiler is not responsible to show and even check them.
// - Implementation-defined behavior - each implementation must document its effects
// - Unspecified Behavior - implementation may not document its effects
// - Undefined Behaviour (UB) - no restrictions on the behavior of the program

// ill-formed programs raise CE
